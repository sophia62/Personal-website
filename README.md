# README for Sophia Beebe's Static Website

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my personal static website, hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket and accessible via my custom domain [sophiabeebe.com](http://sophiabeebe.com). This website serves as a portfolio showcasing my education, certifications, and various projects for potential employers and collaborators.

### Purpose
The main goal of this website is to provide an easy way for employers to view:
- My educational background
- Certifications and achievements
- Software engineering and data analysis projects
- Professional skills and accomplishments

## Hosting and Domain Setup

### Hosting with S3 Bucket
The website is hosted using an **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket**, which allows for static website hosting with high availability and scalability. 

### Custom Domain Setup
I created an **A record** in my domain's DNS configuration that points directly to the S3 bucket. This allows visitors to use my custom domain, `sophiabeebe.com`, to access the website seamlessly.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure and content of the website.
